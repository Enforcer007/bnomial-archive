## Title - Breaking a function down into pieces


### **Question** :

We are trying to predict the price of a car.

Our company has a website where users sell and buy used cars. Deciding how much we should charge for a used car is complicated and error-prone.

We want to build an automatic price recommendation system using supervised learning.

The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the car is our target variable. Since its distribution has a very long tail, we apply a log transformation before training the model.

**If our model for a single observation is `y = f(x)`, what are `x` and `y` for this project?**


### **Choices** :

- `x` is a feature vector containing the variables that describe the car, and `y` is the logarithm of the price of the car.
- `x` is a feature vector containing the variables that describe the car, and `y` is the price of the car.
- `y` is a feature vector containing the variables that describe the car, and `x` is the logarithm of the price of the car.
- `y` is a feature vector containing the variables that describe the car, and `x` is the price of the car.
