## Title - Mia and the feedback loop

### **Question** :

Mia was crushing her thesis!

She was about to release a new neural network architecture that promised to raise the bar on image classification problems.

Mia did not start from scratch. She modified an existing model but added a key ingredient: feedback loops.

A feedback loop is when connections between units form a directed cycle, thus creating loops in the network. This gave Mia's network the ability to save information in the hidden layers.

Mia did a lot of research before deciding in favor of this architecture. She knew the advantages of her decision.

**Which was the architecture that Mia studied to learn about feedback loops?**

### **Choices** :

- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Multilayer Perceptron
- Radial Basis Function Network

## Title - Harper and the small gradients


### **Question** :

Harper's team is struggling with the deep neural network they have been building.

Unfortunately, during backpropagation, the gradient values of their network decrease dramatically as the process gets closer to the initial layers, preventing them from learning at the same pace as the last set of layers.

Harper knows their model suffers from the vanishing gradient problem. She decides to research every possible option to improve their model.

**Which of the following techniques will make Harper's model more robust to the vanishing gradient problem?**


### **Choices** :

- Harper should try ReLU as the activation function since it's well-known for mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.
- Harper should modify the model architecture to introduce Batch Normalization.
- Harper should make sure they are initializing the weights properly. For example, using He initialization should help with the vanishing gradient problem.
- Harper should increase the learning rate to avoid getting stuck in local minima and thus reduce the chance of suffering vanishing gradients.

## Title - Exploring data before anything else


### **Question** :

An essential step in any machine learning project is the Exploratory Data Analysis process.

Before we can train a model, we need to understand our data. As the name suggests, Exploratory Data Analysis allows us to explore the data to discover potential problems or patterns that we can use.

**Which of the following are some of the steps we take during this process?**


### **Choices** :

- Learn the distribution of the target variable.
- Understand the features in the dataset and the distribution of their values.
- Evaluate the performance of our models on this data.
- Assess the data quality, including missing or corrupt values.

## Title - Susan needs to make a decision


### **Question** :

The deadline is approaching, and Susan still hasn't decided which version of her classification model to deploy to production.

She experimented with different hyperparameters, and now she has two models that perform pretty well. 

Her problem is that none of these models is better than the other in every situation. One model has a higher recall but worse precision than the other. Susan can improve the precision by playing with different thresholds, but now the recall decreases.

**How can Susan decide which is the best overall model?**


### **Choices** :

- Susan should tune the thresholds until both have a recall of 95% and choose the one with higher precision.
- Susan should tune the thresholds until both have a precision of 95% and choose the one with a higher recall.
- Susan should compute the area under the curve for both models and choose the one with the higher value.
- There's no objective way to decide which model is best. Susan should pick either one of them.
